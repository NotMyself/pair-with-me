My name is Bobby Johnson and I live in Olympia, WA. I generally go by the handle NotMyself on the internet. I have been a software developer since 1999. In those 20 years, I have worked for a lot of companies building all kinds of software. I have worked alone, on small teams, on large teams, waterfall teams, agile teams and remote teams. I have a [blog](https://iamnotmyself.com/), and [twitter](https://twitter.com/NotMyself) as well as profiles on[github](https://github.com/NotMyself), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/notmyself74/) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/303/notmyself). You can get to know me in those places.

I currently work at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as a developer evangelist. This was a career path I chose deliberately after a steady drumbeat of employers who wanted me to go into management, either managing direct reports or directing the architecture of a project; neither of which hold my interest for very long. I have always loved programming and I don't want to take a position that removes my hands from code for any length of time.  To me, developer evangelism means that my primary role is to teach, teaching is fun and holds my interest.

I am kicking off a new idea on my [Twitch.tv](https://notmyself.livecoders.dev) stream and I want you to participate. I am looking for junior developers to join me on stream for a pair programming session. In these sessions we will cover two primary goals: 

- I teach you about something you are confused about.
- You teach me about something you are knowledgeable about.

And of course there are some secondary benefits, we get to:

- Learn a little bit about you.
- Learn a little bit about me.

If this interests you, please file an [request](https://github.com/NotMyself/pair-with-me/issues/new?assignees=NotMyself&labels=New&template=request.md&title=Name+-+Topic+-+Language).

## What is a Junior Developer

This definition is a little bit squishy on purpose to not exclude anyone that may not meet the letter of the definition while meeting the spirit of the project. A junior developer in my estimation is someone who has been programming for around three (3) years either professionally or recreationally. They have a handle on the basics of their first programming language and maybe know the basics of a couple others (yes T-SQL and HTML count).

## What is the process?

- **Step 1:** File a [request](https://github.com/NotMyself/pair-with-me/issues/new?assignees=NotMyself&labels=New&template=request.md&title=Name+-+Topic+-+Language).
- **Step 2:** Your request will be evaluated and labeled either Accepted or Rejected.
  - If your request is rejected, I will do my best to give you feedback on why.
- **Step 3:** Once accepted, I will reach out to you to schedule a quick meeting to verify you meet the requirements.
  - Once requirements are met, your request will be labeled Verified.
- **Step 4:** We collaborate to find a time to stream, once agreed your request will be labeled Scheduled.
- **Step 5** We do the stream! I record it and post it to YouTube. Finally your request is marked Completed.

**Note: ** If for any reason communication breaks down, or we can't find a time your request will be marked Abandoned.
